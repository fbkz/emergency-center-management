# emergency-center-management
My first application in OOP. (june 2017)

Using C# I had to make a console application to simulate an emergency center management software, among other functionality it had:
* Login functionality for both doctors and nurses
* Serve users and do the medical screening as a nurse
* Receive the users as a doctor and do the consultation
* Keeping records of the consultations
* Display the users: currently on the facility / all of them
* Search for an user
* Registering an user in the facility
